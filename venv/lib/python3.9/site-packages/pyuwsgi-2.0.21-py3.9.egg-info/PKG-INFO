# The uWSGI server as a Python module

## Install

```
pip install pyuwsgi
```

## Run

uWSGI will get installed to your Python path with a console script named `pyuwsgi`. To
make it a full drop-in replacement it will install a script named `uwsgi` as well.

You can also call it directly in your Python code with a list of valid uWSGI options:

```python
import pyuwsgi
pyuwsgi.run(["--help"])
```

## Differences from uWSGI

This is built from uWSGI's source without any modifications.
A different [`setup.py`](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/blob/uwsgi-2.0/setup.pyuwsgi.py)
is used to make the project a friendlier part of the Python ecosystem. It allows it
to be imported as a Python module and distributed using the
[wheel format](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/). The pre-packaged wheels
include the following common libraries used by uWSGI:

* [zlib](https://zlib.net/)
* [pcre](https://www.pcre.org/)
* [jansson](http://www.digip.org/jansson/)

SSL is intentionally excluded for security reasons. If you need SSL support, you can
force a wheel to be built locally with the `pip` flag `--no-binary=pyuwsgi`.

In addition to the default plugins, the [`stats_pusher_statsd`](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Metrics.html#statsd)
plugin is included by default in `pyuwsgi` where it is typically optional for uWSGI.

The full uWSGI documentation can be found at
[https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io).

uWSGI is licensed [GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt) with
a [linking exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_linking_exception) which means
you are allowed to use uWSGI (or pyuwsgi) unmodified in a proprietary or otherwise non-GPL
licensed project without invoking the GPL on the rest of the code.
