# dig-web
dig web console - simple but powerful web console for the BINDâ€™s Domain Information Groper (dig) Tool - the powerful lookup tool for the DNS.
beside dig, it offers the delv DNSSEC analyzer / validator too.

(dig-web is a fork of avasylev/dig-net - thx to avasylev)

For user security reasons, all elements are bundled with the code.
